#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to check Pipfile.lock into git.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install them.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to check poetry.lock into git.
